				AD Casters rely more on their skill-set for damage as opposed to an AD carry which rely on auto-attacks. One key requirement is for their skills to scale well with  Additionally in terms of play style most AD casters will have and use their gap closers to initiate on an enemy whereas an AD carry generally reserves them for kiting
				AD casters generally do not require attack speed in their build, but since their positioning is generally more dangerous than that of an AD carry survivability might become a problem. In some cases early defensive items and careful positioning might be required if you find yourself unable to finish your burst.
