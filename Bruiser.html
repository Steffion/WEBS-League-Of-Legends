			A Bruiser is a tank and an attack damage mix. Bruisers generally also have pretty strong lane sustain that allow<br> 
			them to farm. They're steady and reliable DPS for your team, not high or accurate enough to be a classic carry but enough of a threat to warrant focusing. <br>
			They can also dish out TONS OF DAMAGE (As Phreak would say), but not enough to count as a true Carry.

			A couple of Bruiser Champions are: <br>
			Garen <br>
			Darius <br>
			Irelia <br>
			Renekton <br>
