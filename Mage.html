			Mages are champions who typically possess great reach, ability-based area of effect daChampionPosition and crowd control, and who use all of these strengths in tandem with each other to trap and destroy enemies from a distance. 
			Specializing in magic damage, often burst damage, and therefore investing heavily in items that allow them to cast stronger and faster spells, mages excel at chaining their abilities together in powerful comboes in order to win fights,
			though their abilities also tend to be difficult to land and can be mitigated, if not avoided completely, by their targets if they react in time.
		</p>

		<p>
			Though mages tend to focus on killing prime targets in combat, they can also fall back to their innate crowd control and utility to manipulate key opponents, protecting their team from them or setting them up for a takedown,
			and in the right circumstances can damage and control multiple enemies at a time. In spite of the influence they exert, mages tend to be innately fragile, and fall quickly to direct strikes.

			A couple of mage champions are: <br>
			Anivia <br>
			Cassiopeia <br>
			Viktor <br>
			Ziggs <br>
