				The ADCarry ( Attack damage Carry ) 
				Is a person who deals damage via ranged auto attacks, utilizes life steal for surviving, builds attack speed, and sometimes critical strike chance. 
				They also use abilities that are generally enhanced by building attack damage items. A lot of them are good at poking and harassing from a safe distance. 
				Not only that, but many Marksman (though not all) have steroid abilities that boost their attacks in some way. 
				In the game, your job is to last hit as many minions as possible so you can get the gold to buy items. 
				Last hitting is CRUCIAL for the AD Carry because this type of champ is dependent on gold in order to buy necessary items. 
				As a Marksman levels, they do not get very strong naturally. They get overwhelmingly strong through buying items. So when it comes down to chasing that
				Ashe back to her tower just to do a few ticks of damage, or staying behind to past hit the minion wave, stay back. 
				Only chase if you know you can secure the kill. Another thing you need to do as a Marksman, is stay alive. 
				During the late game phase, you will be crucial for taking towers and inhibitors. Your attack speed and damage are vital for pushing objectives like that quickly and safely.
